# CheapShot2A
 
Once upon a time, on a GitHub far, far away, there was a gun repo. And not just any gun repo, oh no! This gun repo had all sorts of goodies.

It had 3D Printed parts, and schematics, and manuals, and guides OH MY!

And then....when the world needed it the most, it vanished!

We'll, the YouTube Channel CheapShot is bringing it back!

Please consider supporting the channel and this repo. https://linktr.ee/CheapShot
